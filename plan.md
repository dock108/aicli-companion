# Claude Companion - Project Complete

## Development Guidelines

### Core Principles
1. **No Random Fallbacks**: Never add arbitrary default values or fallback behaviors. If something is unclear, ask for clarification or mark with a TODO comment.

2. **Ask Questions Sparingly**: 
   - Only interrupt for showstoppers (e.g., missing critical dependencies, architectural decisions)
   - For non-blocking issues, add descriptive TODO comments and continue
   - Batch questions when possible to minimize interruptions

3. **No Invented Functionality**:
   - Only implement what's explicitly requested or clearly needed
   - Don't add "nice-to-have" features without discussion
   - Stick to fixing the identified problems

4. **Clear TODOs for Unclear Areas**:
   ```javascript
   // TODO: [QUESTION] Should we limit message history size to prevent memory issues?
   // Current assumption: store all messages, but may need pagination
   // Questions: 
   // - Max messages per session?
   // - Should old messages be archived?
   ```

5. **Descriptive Comments for Complex Logic**:
   ```javascript
   // IMPLEMENTATION NOTE: Persisting messages to disk on each buffer update
   // Alternative considered: Batch writes every N seconds for performance
   // Decision: Immediate persistence ensures no data loss on crashes
   ```

## TODO Tracking Guidelines
Throughout implementation, TODOs will be marked with:
- `TODO: [BLOCKING]` - Must be resolved before continuing
- `TODO: [QUESTION]` - Need user input, but can continue
- `TODO: [OPTIMIZE]` - Performance improvement opportunity
- `TODO: [RESEARCH]` - Need to investigate best approach

## Quality Standards

### Code Quality
- All tests must pass before marking a phase complete
- Maintain >80% code coverage
- Zero linting errors allowed
- Proper error handling and logging
- Consistent code style throughout

### Documentation Standards
- Every new API endpoint must be documented
- Complex functions need JSDoc comments
- Configuration changes must update README
- Architecture decisions should be recorded

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for all new functionality
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- Error scenarios must be tested
- Performance impact should be measured

### ðŸš§ Phase 8: Complete Messaging Architecture Overhaul (READY FOR TESTING)
**Duration**: 8-10 hours  
**Priority**: CRITICAL  
**Started**: January 2025
**Status**: Core implementation complete, ready for user testing

## Core Architecture Change: Server as Pure Claude CLI Passthrough

### Problem Statement
The current architecture has fundamental flaws:
1. **Server manages session IDs instead of Claude CLI**: Server generates and persists its own session IDs, ignoring Claude's actual session management
2. **Session desynchronization**: Server thinks sessions exist when Claude doesn't recognize them
3. **Complex state management**: Server tracks client navigation state when it should be stateless
4. **Message delivery issues**: Messages queued but not delivered properly on reconnect
5. **iOS app confusion**: App doesn't know whether to trust server or Claude for session state

### Solution: Transform Server into Pure Passthrough

#### Core Principles
1. **Claude CLI is the source of truth** for all session management
2. **Server is stateless** - just passes messages between iOS and Claude
3. **iOS app manages session persistence** - stores session IDs locally
4. **No server-side session tracking** - server doesn't care about sessions
5. **Message-driven architecture** - no awareness of client state

#### Correct Message Flow

**Fresh Chat (No Session):**
1. iOS sends message WITHOUT session ID to server
2. Server passes to Claude CLI without --session-id flag
3. Claude creates new session and returns session ID in response
4. Server extracts session ID from Claude's response and returns to iOS
5. iOS stores session ID for future messages

**Continued Chat (With Session):**
1. iOS sends message WITH session ID to server
2. Server passes to Claude CLI with --session-id flag
3. Claude continues conversation in existing session
4. Server returns Claude's response to iOS
5. iOS updates local session state if needed

**Session Not Found:**
1. iOS sends message with session ID
2. Server passes to Claude with --session-id
3. Claude returns "No conversation found" error
4. Server returns error to iOS
5. iOS clears local session and retries as fresh chat

### Implementation Tasks

#### 8.1 Extract and Pass Claude Session IDs âœ… COMPLETED
**Changes Implemented:**
- âœ… Parse Claude's system init messages for session IDs
- âœ… Extract session ID from responses like `{"type":"system","system":"use_prompt_caching","session_id":"3440e0a4-96e1-4a5b-99a4-c8f743be0a28"}`
- âœ… Return Claude's session ID in all responses (systemInit, conversationResult, assistantMessage)
- âœ… Updated iOS data structures to receive claudeSessionId
- âœ… Added handlers in iOS to extract and store Claude's session IDs

**Files Modified:**
- `server/src/services/stream-parser.js` - Added session ID extraction
- `server/src/services/aicli-message-handler.js` - Extract and buffer session IDs
- `server/src/services/aicli.js` - Pass Claude's session ID in responses
- `ios/Sources/AICLICompanion/Message.swift` - Added claudeSessionId fields
- `ios/Sources/AICLICompanion/Views/Chat/ViewModels/ChatViewModel.swift` - Handle session IDs

#### 8.2 Update Server to Pass Through Session IDs âœ… COMPLETED
**Changes Implemented:**
- âœ… Modified sendStreamingPrompt to not generate session IDs
- âœ… Created sendPromptToClaude method that passes session IDs to Claude
- âœ… Added minimal session tracking for response routing only
- âœ… Server now accepts messages without session IDs for fresh chats
- âœ… Server passes through iOS session IDs to Claude for continued chats

**Files Modified:**
- `server/src/services/aicli.js` - Removed session ID generation
- `server/src/services/aicli-session-manager.js` - Added minimal tracking
- `server/src/services/websocket-message-handlers.js` - Handles optional session IDs

#### 8.3 Complete Server Session Management Removal - Pure Passthrough Architecture âœ… COMPLETED
**Problem**: Server is still creating sessions and managing state when it should be a pure passthrough. iOS app unnecessarily notifies server when opening folders.

**Solution**: Complete removal of server-side session management and folder selection notifications.

**Implementation Tasks:**

**8.3.1 Complete iOS App Cleanup - Remove All Project Start Logic** âœ… COMPLETED
- âœ… `ios/Sources/AICLICompanion/ProjectSelectionView.swift`
  - Remove entirely: `startProjectSession()`, `continueExistingSession()`, `startFreshSession()` methods
  - Simplify `selectProject()` to just: set selectedProject, set isProjectSelected = true  
  - Remove all server API calls, loading states, error handling for project start
  - Remove ProjectStartResponse, ProjectSession structs (no longer needed)
  - Keep only: Project listing and simple selection

- âœ… `ios/Sources/AICLICompanion/AICLIService.swift`
  - Remove any methods calling `/api/projects/:name/start`
  - Clean up project session management code
- âœ… `ios/Sources/AICLICompanion/Views/Chat/ViewModels/ChatViewModel.swift`
  - Remove `startSession()` method that called `startProjectSession()`
- âœ… `ios/Sources/AICLICompanion/Services/Chat/ChatSessionManager.swift`
  - Remove `createSession()` method that called `startProjectSession()`

**8.3.2 Server Routes Complete Cleanup** âœ… COMPLETED
- âœ… `server/src/routes/projects.js`
  - Remove entirely: POST `/projects/:name/start` endpoint (lines 152-423)
  - Remove entirely: `activeSessions` Map and all related code
  - Remove: Session cleanup event listeners
  - Remove: GET/DELETE `/sessions/:sessionId` endpoints (lines 426-530)
  - Keep only: GET `/projects` (list projects), GET `/projects/:name` (project info)

**8.3.3 New iOS Project Selection Flow (Ultra-Simple)**
1. User taps project â†’ iOS immediately navigates to chat (NO server notification)
2. iOS stores selected project locally only
3. Chat view loads local messages if any exist
4. When user sends first message â†’ normal WebSocket message flow creates Claude session
5. No server awareness of "current project" - server is stateless

**8.3.4 Remove All Server-Side Session Awareness** âœ… COMPLETED
- âœ… Remove any remaining session tracking in server
- âœ… Remove session persistence calls during project selection  
- âœ… Remove welcome message generation
- âœ… Server only handles: project listing, WebSocket messages, Claude CLI passthrough

#### 8.4 Update iOS App for Local Session Management âœ… COMPLETED
**Changes Implemented:**
- âœ… Added claudeSessionId fields to message structs
- âœ… Added handlers to extract Claude's session IDs from responses
- âœ… Update currentSessionId when Claude returns different ID
- âœ… Modified iOS to send messages without session ID for fresh chats
- âœ… Store Claude's session IDs in local persistence
- âœ… Send Claude's session ID with continued conversations
- âœ… Removed pre-session creation flow in ChatView
- âœ… Added updateSessionMetadata to persistence service

**Files Modified:**
- `ios/Sources/AICLICompanion/Views/Chat/ChatView.swift` - Direct message sending
- `ios/Sources/AICLICompanion/Views/Chat/ViewModels/ChatViewModel.swift` - Session ID handling
- `ios/Sources/AICLICompanion/MessagePersistenceService.swift` - Session ID updates

#### 8.5 Testing and Validation ðŸš§ READY FOR TESTING
**What to Test:**
1. **Fresh Chat Flow**:
   - Open iOS app, send message without any existing session
   - Verify Claude creates session and iOS receives session ID
   - Verify subsequent messages use Claude's session ID

2. **Continued Chat Flow**:
   - Close and reopen iOS app
   - Send message in existing chat
   - Verify Claude recognizes session and continues conversation

3. **Session Not Found Flow**:
   - Manually clear Claude's sessions
   - Try to continue existing chat in iOS
   - Verify graceful handling and new session creation

4. **Message Queue Delivery**:
   - Send message and immediately background app
   - Verify message delivered when app returns

**Known Issues to Watch For:**
- Server may still have some session persistence code that needs cleanup
- Error handling for "No conversation found" needs testing
- Message queue delivery on reconnect needs verification

### Success Criteria
1. **Server never generates session IDs** - only uses Claude's
2. **iOS app manages all session state** locally
3. **Messages delivered reliably** regardless of app state
4. **No session desynchronization** - Claude is source of truth
5. **Server remains stateless** - can restart without losing context
6. **Clean error handling** when sessions don't exist

### Migration Strategy
1. First implement session ID extraction from Claude
2. Update iOS to handle session IDs locally
3. Gradually remove server session management
4. Test extensively at each step
5. Ensure backward compatibility during transition

---

## Phase 5: macOS Host App Modernization
**Duration**: 25 hours  
**Priority**: High  
**Dependencies**: None (can start immediately)

### Objective
Transform the current Tauri-based host app (`server/hostapp`) into a sleek, modern native macOS menu bar application using SwiftUI. Create a best-in-class developer tool that feels truly native to macOS.

### Implementation Guidelines

**YOU HAVE CARTE BLANCHE TO:**
- Completely redesign the UI/UX
- Choose the best architecture patterns
- Add any features that make sense for a modern macOS app
- Use any macOS frameworks and APIs
- Create delightful animations and interactions
- Implement any performance optimizations

**ONLY STOP FOR:**
1. **Showstoppers**: Missing critical dependencies, major architectural decisions that could go multiple ways
2. **Testing Input**: When you need me to test specific functionality on actual hardware
3. **User Preferences**: If there are multiple equally good options and you need my preference

**DO NOT STOP FOR:**
- Minor implementation details
- Standard macOS patterns (just follow Apple's HIG)
- Feature additions that obviously improve the app
- Performance optimizations
- UI polish and animations

### Development Approach

Start by creating a new native macOS app using SwiftUI. You can either:
1. Create a new Xcode project in a `macos-app` directory
2. Or gradually transform the Tauri app if that makes more sense

The app should be a menu bar application that:
- Lives in the menu bar with a beautiful custom icon
- Shows server status at a glance
- Provides quick access to all functionality
- Feels incredibly fast and responsive
- Delights users with thoughtful details

### Core Requirements

1. **Menu Bar Excellence**
   - Custom icon that shows server status
   - Dropdown with all key information
   - Right-click context menu
   - Keyboard shortcuts for everything

2. **Native macOS Feel**
   - Use SF Symbols throughout
   - Vibrancy and translucency effects
   - Native controls and animations
   - Respect system appearance (light/dark mode)

3. **Developer-Focused Features**
   - One-click server start/stop
   - Real-time log streaming
   - Session management
   - Network diagnostics
   - Performance monitoring

4. **System Integration**
   - Launch at login
   - Keychain for secure storage
   - Notifications for important events
   - Spotlight and Shortcuts support

### Quality Bar

The final app should:
- Launch instantly (< 1 second)
- Use < 50MB RAM when idle
- Have zero UI freezes
- Feel delightful to use
- Be worthy of featuring on the Mac App Store

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Native macOS menu bar app with SwiftUI
- [ ] All current functionality preserved and enhanced
- [ ] Beautiful, modern UI that follows Apple's HIG
- [ ] Exceptional performance and responsiveness
- [ ] System integration features working perfectly
- [ ] Code is clean, well-documented, and maintainable

### Notes
- Prioritize user experience over feature count
- When in doubt, choose the more native approach
- Add personality and delight where appropriate
- Think about what would make YOU want to use this daily

## Phase 6: Project Cleanup
**Duration**: 2 hours  
**Priority**: High  
**Dependencies**: Phases 1-5 Complete

### Objective
Remove all POC code, test artifacts, and obsolete components. Consolidate to three core components: server, macOS companion app, and iOS app.

### Tasks
- [x] Remove Tauri host app (replaced by native macOS app)
- [x] Clean up test/POC directories
- [x] Remove coverage reports and build artifacts
- [x] Remove debug logging
- [x] Update all documentation
- [ ] Verify all components still functional

### Implementation Plan
1. Update plan.md to track cleanup progress
2. Remove `/server/hostapp/` - entire Tauri app
3. Remove test directories: `/ios-app/`, `/macos-xcode-app/`, `/icon-update/`, `/tests/`
4. Clean coverage and build artifacts
5. Remove debug console.log statements
6. Update documentation to remove Tauri references
7. Verify system integrity

---

## Completion Checklist
When all tasks are complete:
1. [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
2. [ ] Check coverage: `npm run test:coverage`
3. [ ] Lint check: `npm run lint`
4. [ ] Manual testing of all scenarios
5. [ ] Documentation updated
6. [ ] Performance benchmarks completed
7. [ ] Migration tested on existing data
8. [ ] macOS app fully functional and polished
9. [ ] All cleanup tasks completed
10. [ ] Update this plan.md with final status

## Implementation Strategy for Current Phase

### Working Principles
1. **Continuous Progress**: Work on tasks as long as possible before hitting blockers
2. **TodoWrite Tracking**: Use todo system to track all progress
3. **Minimal Interruptions**: Only stop for true showstoppers
4. **Parallel Work**: When blocked on one task, switch to another

### Current Focus
- Debugging iOS message reception with systematic approach
- Building comprehensive CI for all Swift components
- Creating reliable UAT testing framework

## Notes
- Consider adding message history limits in future phase
- May want to add message search functionality later
- Could optimize by batching persistence writes
- WebSocket message size limits may require pagination for very large histories
- Swift CI should match JavaScript coverage requirements (>80%)
