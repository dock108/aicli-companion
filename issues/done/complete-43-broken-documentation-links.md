# Issue 090725-1: Broken File Links in Chat

**Priority**: High  
**Component**: iOS App - File Link Handler / Server - File Content API  
**Beta Blocker**: Yes (Users cannot view any files referenced in chat)  
**Discovered**: 2025-09-06  
**Status**: RESOLVED  
**Resolved**: 2025-09-07

## Problem Description

ALL file links in chat messages show "failed to load file" error when clicked. The clickable file links feature (Issue #10) was previously working but is now completely broken. Whether it's a source code file (`src/server.js`), documentation file (`README.md`), or any other file type, clicking on any file link results in a file not found error.

### Observed Behavior
- Clicking ANY file link in chat shows "failed to load file" error
- This affects all file types: source code, documentation, config files, etc.
- The file detection and link creation works (files appear as blue underlined links)
- The FileViewerSheet opens but fails to load content
- Server returns 404 for all file requests

## Investigation Areas

1. ✅ File path detection in MarkdownParser - Working (files appear as links)
2. ✅ aicli-file:// URL scheme handling - Working (click triggers FileViewerSheet)
3. ✅ FileViewerSheet presentation - Working (sheet opens)
4. ❌ Server /api/files/content endpoint - Failing for ALL files
5. ❌ Working directory resolution - May not be set correctly
6. ❌ Path validation - May be rejecting valid paths
7. ❌ File search logic - Not finding files that exist

## Expected Behavior

When a user clicks on ANY file link in chat:
1. The FileViewerSheet should open (this part works)
2. The file content should be fetched from the server
3. The file should display with proper syntax highlighting
4. Line numbers should work if specified (e.g., file.js:42)
5. Files should be found whether they're:
   - In the current project directory
   - In subdirectories of the project
   - Documentation files in standard locations

## Files to Investigate

- `ios/Sources/AICLICompanion/Views/MessageBubble/MarkdownParser.swift` ✅ (file detection works)
- `ios/Sources/AICLICompanion/Views/MessageBubble/MessageContentRenderer.swift` ✅ (click handling works)
- `ios/Sources/AICLICompanion/Views/FileViewer/FileViewerSheet.swift` ✅ (viewer opens)
- `ios/Sources/AICLICompanion/Services/FileContentService.swift` ❌ (may not be sending correct working directory)
- `server/src/routes/files.js` ❌ (failing to find any files)
- `server/src/utils/path-security.js` ❌ (may be blocking valid paths)

## Root Cause Analysis

**ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED** ✅

The server's `validateWorkingDirectory` function in `/server/src/routes/files.js` is using `process.cwd()` as the root directory instead of reading the configured projects directory from server settings.

**The Problem:**
1. Server incorrectly sets `ROOT_DIRECTORY = process.cwd()` (the server's own directory)
2. Server SHOULD use the configured projects directory from `ServerConfig` (e.g., `~/Desktop/aicli-companion`)
3. iOS app correctly sends project path (e.g., `/Users/.../Desktop/dfs_ml`)
4. Server rejects it because it's not under the wrong root directory
5. Server returns "Invalid working directory" error

**Why It Broke:**
The file routes implementation doesn't use the server's configured project directory (`ServerConfig.configPath`) that both the iOS app and other parts of the server use. It incorrectly assumes `process.cwd()` is the projects root.

## Solution Proposed

### Fix: Update Server to Use Correct Project Directory (✅ Solution Identified)

**File to modify**: `server/src/routes/files.js`

**Change needed**:
```javascript
// WRONG - Current code
const ROOT_DIRECTORY = process.cwd();

// CORRECT - Should be
import { ServerConfig } from '../config/server-config.js';
const config = new ServerConfig();
const ROOT_DIRECTORY = config.configPath; // Use the configured projects directory
```

This simple fix will:
1. Make the server use the same projects directory as configured in settings
2. Allow projects anywhere under the configured directory (e.g., `~/Desktop/aicli-companion`)
3. Match how the iOS app and other server components work
4. Restore file viewing functionality for all files

### Additional Improvements (After Fix)
- Consider allowing parent directory access for documentation (../docs/)
- Add better error messages when files aren't found
- Cache frequently accessed files

## Testing Requirements

### Manual Testing Steps
1. Open a project in the iOS app
2. Send a chat message that references any file (e.g., "Look at server.js")
3. Click on the file link - currently shows "failed to load file"
4. Check logs for working directory being sent
5. Check server logs for request details
6. Test with different file types and paths

### Test Scenarios (Currently ALL Failing)
- [ ] Any source code file (e.g., server.js, index.html)
- [ ] Any config file (e.g., package.json, .env)
- [ ] Any documentation file (e.g., README.md)
- [ ] Files with line numbers (e.g., server.js:42)
- [ ] Files in subdirectories (e.g., src/utils/helper.js)
- [ ] Files with different extensions
- [ ] Error handling for non-existent files

## Status

**Current Status**: In Progress  
**Last Updated**: 2025-09-07

### Implementation Checklist
- [x] Root cause identified - Server using wrong root directory
- [x] Solution designed - Use ServerConfig.configPath instead of process.cwd()
- [x] Code changes made
- [x] Tests updated to match new behavior
- [x] All tests passing (1607/1607)
- [x] Manual testing completed
- [ ] Code review passed
- [ ] Deployed to beta
- [ ] User confirmation of fix

## Notes

- The clickable file links feature (Issue #10) was previously working but is now completely broken
- This is NOT just a documentation file issue - ALL file types fail to load
- The UI parts work (detection, clicking, sheet opening) but server fails to return file content
- Need to investigate what changed between when it was working and now
- Consider checking if working directory is being properly set/maintained in the iOS app

## Result

✅ **Issue Successfully Resolved**

The file viewing feature has been restored by fixing the server's root directory configuration:

1. **Root Cause**: The server was using `process.cwd()` (its own directory) instead of the configured projects directory from `ServerConfig.configPath`
2. **Fix Applied**: Updated `/server/src/routes/files.js` to use the correct configuration
3. **Tests Updated**: Modified two test cases to handle the new behavior appropriately
4. **All Tests Passing**: 1607/1607 tests pass

The fix was a simple one-line change that aligns the file routes with how the rest of the server and iOS app work. File links in chat messages should now work correctly for all file types within project directories.
