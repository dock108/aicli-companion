# Implementation Summary: Message-Driven Architecture

## Overview
This implementation makes the server completely message-driven and removes all client state tracking, fixing the issue where messages weren't delivered when the iOS app was in the background.

## Key Changes

### 1. iOS App Changes
- **Fixed `cleanupView()`**: Removed `sessionManager.closeSession()` call that was closing sessions when navigating away
- **Added Clear Chat Support**: Implemented proper clear chat functionality with new session ID generation
- **Added Message Types**: Extended WebSocket message types to support clearChat/clearChatResponse

### 2. Server Changes

#### Auto-Create Claude Session on First Message
- Added retry logic in `executeAICLICommand()` to handle "No conversation found with session ID" errors
- When Claude CLI doesn't have a session, the server automatically retries without session ID to create a new one
- This fixes the issue where restored sessions would fail with "No conversation found"

#### Removed Background/Foreground Session Tracking
- Removed `markSessionBackgrounded()` and `markSessionForegrounded()` methods from AICLIService
- Removed `client_backgrounding` message handler from WebSocket handlers
- Removed `isBackgrounded` and `backgroundedAt` fields from session manager and persistence
- Server no longer tracks whether client is in foreground/background - it's purely message-driven

#### Message Queue Filtering (Already Implemented)
- Only queues actual chat messages (conversationResult, assistantMessage, streamData, streamComplete, systemInit)
- Filters out process messages (processExit, processStderr) that were incorrectly being queued

## Result
The server is now completely agnostic to client navigation state. Sessions persist regardless of whether the iOS app is open, closed, or navigated away. Messages are queued and delivered when the client reconnects, ensuring reliable message delivery even when the app is backgrounded.

## Key Architecture Principles
1. **Message-Driven**: Server only responds to explicit messages, not client state
2. **Session Persistence**: Sessions survive both server and client restarts
3. **Auto-Recovery**: Automatic session creation when Claude CLI doesn't have the session
4. **No State Tracking**: Server doesn't track foreground/background or navigation state
