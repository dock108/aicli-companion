# Issue #4: Auto-Response Iteration Mode

**Priority**: Medium  
**Component**: Server/iOS Integration  
**Beta Blocker**: No  
**Discovered**: 2025-08-19  
**Status**: New  

## Problem Description

Design an auto-response mode that allows Claude to continue iterating on a task until completion. This would enable Claude to continue working on a task, sending updates as it progresses, until the task is complete or the user manually stops it.

## Investigation Areas

1. A trigger mechanism (keyboard shortcut or UI button) to enable "auto-iterate" mode
2. Claude continues working on the task, sending updates as it progresses
3. Automatic detection when Claude has nothing left to iterate on (completion phrases like "task complete", "finished", etc.)
4. Emergency stop mechanism (hotkey or button) to interrupt auto-iteration
5. Visual indicator showing auto-mode is active
6. Message batching to prevent UI flooding during rapid iterations

## Expected Behavior

User activates auto-mode, Claude continues working and updating progress until the task is complete or user manually stops it.

## Files to Investigate

- `server/src/services/aicli-auto-iterate.js` (to be created)
- `ios/Sources/AICLICompanion/ViewModels/AutoIterateViewModel.swift` (to be created)
- `ios/Sources/AICLICompanion/Views/Chat/AutoIterateControls.swift` (to be created)

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Trigger Mechanism
- UI button to toggle auto-iterate mode
- Keyboard shortcut support

### 2. Completion Detection
- Pattern matching for completion phrases
- Configurable completion triggers

### 3. Safety Features
- Emergency stop button
- Maximum iteration limit
- Timeout protection

## Testing Requirements

### Manual Testing Steps
1. Enable auto-iterate mode
2. Provide a multi-step task
3. Monitor progress updates
4. Test emergency stop

### Test Scenarios
- [ ] Auto-iterate activation
- [ ] Completion detection
- [ ] Emergency stop
- [ ] UI flooding prevention
