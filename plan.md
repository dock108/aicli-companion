# Claude Companion - Project Complete

## Development Guidelines

### Core Principles
1. **No Random Fallbacks**: Never add arbitrary default values or fallback behaviors. If something is unclear, ask for clarification or mark with a TODO comment.

2. **Ask Questions Sparingly**: 
   - Only interrupt for showstoppers (e.g., missing critical dependencies, architectural decisions)
   - For non-blocking issues, add descriptive TODO comments and continue
   - Batch questions when possible to minimize interruptions

3. **No Invented Functionality**:
   - Only implement what's explicitly requested or clearly needed
   - Don't add "nice-to-have" features without discussion
   - Stick to fixing the identified problems

4. **Clear TODOs for Unclear Areas**:
   ```javascript
   // TODO: [QUESTION] Should we limit message history size to prevent memory issues?
   // Current assumption: store all messages, but may need pagination
   // Questions: 
   // - Max messages per session?
   // - Should old messages be archived?
   ```

5. **Descriptive Comments for Complex Logic**:
   ```javascript
   // IMPLEMENTATION NOTE: Persisting messages to disk on each buffer update
   // Alternative considered: Batch writes every N seconds for performance
   // Decision: Immediate persistence ensures no data loss on crashes
   ```

## TODO Tracking Guidelines
Throughout implementation, TODOs will be marked with:
- `TODO: [BLOCKING]` - Must be resolved before continuing
- `TODO: [QUESTION]` - Need user input, but can continue
- `TODO: [OPTIMIZE]` - Performance improvement opportunity
- `TODO: [RESEARCH]` - Need to investigate best approach

## Quality Standards

### Code Quality
- All tests must pass before marking a phase complete
- Maintain >80% code coverage
- Zero linting errors allowed
- Proper error handling and logging
- Consistent code style throughout

### Documentation Standards
- Every new API endpoint must be documented
- Complex functions need JSDoc comments
- Configuration changes must update README
- Architecture decisions should be recorded

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for all new functionality
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- Error scenarios must be tested
- Performance impact should be measured

- [x] Add `loadMessageBuffer(sessionId)` method to restore messages on startup
- [x] Add `removeMessageBuffer(sessionId)` for cleanup when sessions are removed
- [x] Store buffers as separate JSON files: `buffer-{sessionId}.json`

**Success Criteria**:
- [x] Message buffers persist to disk on each update
- [x] Buffers are restored when server restarts
- [x] Old buffer files are cleaned up with sessions

**Files to Modify**:
- `server/src/services/session-persistence.js` - Add message buffer persistence methods
- `server/src/services/aicli-session-manager.js` - Load buffers when restoring sessions

**Testing Plan**:
- [ ] Unit tests for new persistence methods

- **Low Risk**: 
  - Performance impact of disk I/O on message sends
  - Storage space for large numbers of sessions

## Mitigation Strategies
- Implement file locking for concurrent write protection
- Add message history pagination for large conversations
- Use atomic file operations for corruption prevention
- Add storage quotas and cleanup policies
- Cache frequently accessed buffers in memory

## Phase 5: macOS Host App Modernization
**Duration**: 25 hours  
**Priority**: High  
**Dependencies**: None (can start immediately)

### Objective
Transform the current Tauri-based host app (`server/hostapp`) into a sleek, modern native macOS menu bar application using SwiftUI. Create a best-in-class developer tool that feels truly native to macOS.

### Implementation Guidelines

**YOU HAVE CARTE BLANCHE TO:**
- Completely redesign the UI/UX
- Choose the best architecture patterns
- Add any features that make sense for a modern macOS app
- Use any macOS frameworks and APIs
- Create delightful animations and interactions
- Implement any performance optimizations

**ONLY STOP FOR:**
1. **Showstoppers**: Missing critical dependencies, major architectural decisions that could go multiple ways
2. **Testing Input**: When you need me to test specific functionality on actual hardware
3. **User Preferences**: If there are multiple equally good options and you need my preference

**DO NOT STOP FOR:**
- Minor implementation details
- Standard macOS patterns (just follow Apple's HIG)
- Feature additions that obviously improve the app
- Performance optimizations
- UI polish and animations

### Development Approach

Start by creating a new native macOS app using SwiftUI. You can either:
1. Create a new Xcode project in a `macos-app` directory
2. Or gradually transform the Tauri app if that makes more sense

The app should be a menu bar application that:
- Lives in the menu bar with a beautiful custom icon
- Shows server status at a glance
- Provides quick access to all functionality
- Feels incredibly fast and responsive
- Delights users with thoughtful details

### Core Requirements

1. **Menu Bar Excellence**
   - Custom icon that shows server status
   - Dropdown with all key information
   - Right-click context menu
   - Keyboard shortcuts for everything

2. **Native macOS Feel**
   - Use SF Symbols throughout
   - Vibrancy and translucency effects
   - Native controls and animations
   - Respect system appearance (light/dark mode)

3. **Developer-Focused Features**
   - One-click server start/stop
   - Real-time log streaming
   - Session management
   - Network diagnostics
   - Performance monitoring

4. **System Integration**
   - Launch at login
   - Keychain for secure storage
   - Notifications for important events
   - Spotlight and Shortcuts support

### Quality Bar

The final app should:
- Launch instantly (< 1 second)
- Use < 50MB RAM when idle
- Have zero UI freezes
- Feel delightful to use
- Be worthy of featuring on the Mac App Store

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Native macOS menu bar app with SwiftUI
- [ ] All current functionality preserved and enhanced
- [ ] Beautiful, modern UI that follows Apple's HIG
- [ ] Exceptional performance and responsiveness
- [ ] System integration features working perfectly
- [ ] Code is clean, well-documented, and maintainable

### Notes
- Prioritize user experience over feature count
- When in doubt, choose the more native approach
- Add personality and delight where appropriate
- Think about what would make YOU want to use this daily

## Phase 6: Project Cleanup
**Duration**: 2 hours  
**Priority**: High  
**Dependencies**: Phases 1-5 Complete

### Objective
Remove all POC code, test artifacts, and obsolete components. Consolidate to three core components: server, macOS companion app, and iOS app.

### Tasks
- [x] Remove Tauri host app (replaced by native macOS app)
- [x] Clean up test/POC directories
- [x] Remove coverage reports and build artifacts
- [x] Remove debug logging
- [x] Update all documentation
- [ ] Verify all components still functional

### Implementation Plan
1. Update plan.md to track cleanup progress
2. Remove `/server/hostapp/` - entire Tauri app
3. Remove test directories: `/ios-app/`, `/macos-xcode-app/`, `/icon-update/`, `/tests/`
4. Clean coverage and build artifacts
5. Remove debug console.log statements
6. Update documentation to remove Tauri references
7. Verify system integrity

---

## Completion Checklist
When all tasks are complete:
1. [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
2. [ ] Check coverage: `npm run test:coverage`
3. [ ] Lint check: `npm run lint`
4. [ ] Manual testing of all scenarios
5. [ ] Documentation updated
6. [ ] Performance benchmarks completed
7. [ ] Migration tested on existing data
8. [ ] macOS app fully functional and polished
9. [ ] All cleanup tasks completed
10. [ ] Update this plan.md with final status

## Implementation Strategy for Current Phase

### Working Principles
1. **Continuous Progress**: Work on tasks as long as possible before hitting blockers
2. **TodoWrite Tracking**: Use todo system to track all progress
3. **Minimal Interruptions**: Only stop for true showstoppers
4. **Parallel Work**: When blocked on one task, switch to another

### Current Focus
- Debugging iOS message reception with systematic approach
- Building comprehensive CI for all Swift components
- Creating reliable UAT testing framework

## Notes
- Consider adding message history limits in future phase
- May want to add message search functionality later
- Could optimize by batching persistence writes
- WebSocket message size limits may require pagination for very large histories
- Swift CI should match JavaScript coverage requirements (>80%)
