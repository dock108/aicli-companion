# Issue 091225-2: Auto-Reply and Sync Failed Messages Show When Feature is Disabled

**Priority**: High  
**Component**: iOS App - Chat UI  
**Beta Blocker**: Yes - UI displays incorrect status  
**Discovered**: 2025-09-12  
**Status**: New  

## Problem Description

The auto-reply status messages and sync failed notifications are still displaying under the chat title even when the auto-reply feature is turned off. This creates confusion about the actual state of the feature and clutters the UI with irrelevant information.

## Observed Behavior

- Auto-reply feature is disabled in settings
- Chat UI still shows auto-reply status messages below the title
- "Sync failed" messages appear even though feature is off
- Creates confusion about whether auto-reply is actually active
- UI shows status for a disabled feature

## Expected Behavior

- When auto-reply is disabled, no auto-reply status should be shown
- Sync failed messages should not appear for disabled features
- Chat UI should only show relevant status information
- Clean UI without disabled feature indicators

## Impact

Users see confusing status messages for a disabled feature, making them uncertain about whether auto-reply is actually off. This reduces trust in the settings and creates unnecessary UI clutter.

## Potential Root Causes

1. **Missing Feature Flag Check**: UI components not checking if auto-reply is enabled before showing status
2. **Status Persistence**: Old status messages persisting after feature is disabled
3. **Incomplete Feature Toggle**: Settings disable functionality but not UI elements
4. **State Management Issue**: Auto-reply state not properly propagated to UI components
5. **Sync Status Logic**: Sync failed logic running regardless of feature state

## Suggested Solutions

### Immediate Fix
1. Add feature flag check before displaying auto-reply status
2. Hide all auto-reply related UI when feature is disabled
3. Clear existing status messages when feature is toggled off

### Complete Solution
1. Audit all auto-reply UI components for proper feature flag checks
2. Ensure settings changes immediately update all relevant UI
3. Add cleanup logic when feature is disabled
4. Separate sync status from auto-reply feature status
5. Consider making UI updates reactive to settings changes

## Files to Investigate

- `ChatView.swift` - Main chat UI with title and status display
- `AutoReplyStatusView.swift` (if exists) - Auto-reply status component
- `SettingsManager.swift` - Feature flag management
- `ChatViewModel.swift` - Chat state and status management
- Any sync status related components

## Testing Requirements

1. Verify auto-reply status hidden when feature is off
2. Toggle feature on/off and verify UI updates immediately
3. Check that sync failed messages don't appear for disabled features
4. Ensure no residual status messages after disabling
5. Test across different chat sessions and app restarts

- Settings Overhaul (Test Note 4) - Settings organization and functionality

## Notes

This is a UI consistency issue that affects user trust in the settings system. The fix should be straightforward - ensuring all auto-reply related UI elements check the feature flag before displaying.
