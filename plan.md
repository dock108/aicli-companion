# Fix Critical App State and Message Delivery Issues

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The iOS app currently has critical issues with stuck loading states, disappearing thinking indicators, broken long-running message delivery, and session state confusion between projects. This plan systematically fixes these issues while removing dead/duplicate code and optimizing performance.

## CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS

### Problems Identified
1. **Loading State Stuck**: After pull-to-refresh, `isLoading` stays true permanently, blocking send button
2. **Thinking Indicator Disappears**: "Coffee brewing" indicator vanishes on app background/foreground cycles
3. **Long-Running Messages Broken**: APNS delivery stopped working despite polling resumption logs
4. **Session State Confusion**: Wrong session IDs used across projects in blocking logic
5. **Performance Issues**: Excessive state updates causing UI constraint conflicts

### Root Causes
- Recent `clearLoadingState` optimizations are backfiring
- Thinking indicators not persisting across app lifecycle
- APNS delivery pipeline broken somewhere in the chain
- Session ID management getting confused between projects
- Too many UI updates triggering constraint recalculations

#### Progress State Confusion
- `progressInfo` in ChatViewModel
- `persistentThinkingInfo` in ProjectState
- `projectStates[].progressInfo` per-project
- ProgressInfo vs ProgressResponse types
**Impact**: Progress indicator confusion

### 🟢 Low Priority Naming Issues

#### Confusing Variable Names

## CRITICAL CODE PATTERNS

### Always Remove Dead Code Immediately
```swift
// DELETE these patterns when found:
// Old loading state checks that don't work
// Commented-out debugging code
// Redundant state tracking
// Unused timer management
// Broken polling logic
// Duplicate helper methods
// Unused variables and properties
// Old TODO comments
```

### Feature Flag Exceptions
Only preserve code if:
- It's controlled by FeatureFlags and may be re-enabled
- It's part of queue system (disabled but may return)
- It's part of auto mode (disabled but may return)

### No Code Comments About Removals

2. Verify AppDelegate processes background notifications

### ❌ Known Issues (Require APNS Configuration)

**Issue**: Server APNS Not Configured
- **Symptom**: Messages don't arrive when app is backgrounded
- **Cause**: Server .env has APNS keys commented out
- **Workaround**: Test with app in foreground only
- **Resolution**: Provide valid APNS .p8 key and configuration
