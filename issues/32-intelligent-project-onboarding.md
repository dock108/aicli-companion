# Issue #32: Intelligent Project Onboarding & Planning System

**Priority**: High  
**Component**: iOS App - Project Creation UI (Server: Template Storage)  
**Beta Blocker**: No  
**Discovered**: 2025-08-27  
**Status**: New  
**Resolved**: [YYYY-MM-DD if resolved]

## Problem Description

Need to implement a comprehensive intelligent project onboarding system in the iOS app that provides professional-grade project creation with built-in planning validation. The iOS app handles all UI/UX for project creation, wizards, and validation dashboards, while the server provides template storage, file operations, and validation logic APIs. The system should guide users through proper project setup, validate requirements completeness, and ensure projects start with everything needed for successful development.

**Note: This is a STANDALONE feature** that can be used independently. While Issue #34 (Autonomous Coding Agent) will leverage this system for project creation, Issue #32 provides value on its own for users who want intelligent project setup without full automation.

**This tool is specifically designed for building modular, production-grade applications** - not quick prompts or proof-of-concepts. It's for technical users who need structured, enterprise-level development workflows: experienced engineers building real production systems with proper architecture, testing, and deployment considerations.

The system should provide:

**Intelligent Project Creation:**
- In-app project creation with enterprise-grade templates
- Auto-generation of essential project files (plan.md, CLAUDE.md, issues/)
- Template customization based on project type and requirements
- Version-controlled template evolution

**Planning Session Intelligence:**
- Real-time requirements completeness assessment
- Intelligent gap detection across all project domains
- Database schema validation and relationship checking
- API contract completeness verification
- UI/UX specification validation
- Security and authentication requirement checks
- Performance and scalability consideration validation
- Deployment and infrastructure requirement analysis

**Smart Validation & Feedback:**
- Readiness scoring with confidence metrics
- Specific identification of missing requirements
- Contextual warnings about incomplete specifications
- Automated checklist generation for gap resolution
- Override mechanism with informed consent

**Target Use Cases:**
- Senior engineers prototyping new products with production intent
- Technical founders building MVPs with proper engineering foundations
- Engineering teams doing rapid iteration on real features
- Advanced developers who want structured, repeatable development workflows

## Investigation Areas

1. **Project Creation System**:
   - In-app project folder creation and management
   - Template file auto-generation system
   - Project switching and organization
   - Template versioning and evolution

2. **Template Generation Engine**:
   - Dynamic template customization based on project type
   - TDD workflow automation using plan.md structure
   - CLAUDE.md guidelines with project-specific rules
   - Issue template generation with acceptance criteria
   - Version control integration for template files

3. **Planning Validation Intelligence** ‚≠ê *Critical Component*:
   - Requirements completeness assessment algorithms
   - Multi-domain gap detection (DB, API, UI/UX, Security, etc.)
   - Confidence scoring and readiness metrics
   - Natural language processing for requirement extraction
   - Pattern matching for common missing specifications

4. **Intelligent Feedback System**:
   - Real-time validation during planning conversations
   - Specific, actionable feedback on missing items
   - Severity levels for different types of gaps
   - Checklist generation with priority ordering
   - Context-aware suggestions for completion

5. **UI/UX Components**:
   - Project creation wizard interface
   - Template editing and preview system
   - Project browser and management UI
   - Planning validation dashboard
   - Requirements checklist view

## Expected Behavior

**Professional Project Creation Flow:**
1. User taps "New Project" in iOS app
2. App prompts for project details:
   - Project name and description
   - Architecture type (monolith, microservices, serverless)
   - Target environment (web, mobile, desktop)
   - Team size and collaboration needs
3. System auto-generates enterprise-grade templates:
   - `plan.md` - Comprehensive TDD planning document
   - `CLAUDE.md` - Engineering guidelines and quality gates
   - `issues/template.md` - Structured issue template
   - Additional templates based on project type
4. Opens planning session with intelligent validation

**Planning Session Validation Flow:**
1. User discusses project requirements with Claude
2. System continuously analyzes conversation for completeness
3. Real-time assessment across critical domains:
   - **Database**: Schema, relationships, constraints, migrations
   - **API**: Contracts, endpoints, authentication, rate limiting
   - **UI/UX**: User flows, wireframes, component specifications
   - **Security**: Authentication, authorization, data protection
   - **Performance**: Load expectations, caching, optimization
   - **Infrastructure**: Deployment, monitoring, scaling
4. Dynamic feedback provided:
   - ‚úÖ "Database schema looks complete with all relationships defined"
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è "Missing API authentication strategy - OAuth2, JWT, or API keys?"
   - üö® "No UI component specifications found for user dashboard"
   - üìã "7 requirements still needed before development ready"
5. Readiness score updates in real-time
6. Override option available with clear warnings

**Template Evolution:**
1. Templates start at v0.1.0 during creation
2. Planning session refinements increment to v0.x
3. Ready for development promotes to v1.0.0
4. Project-specific customizations tracked
5. Learnings can be saved back as new template variants
