# Issue #1: iOS Project Status Indicator Not Working

**Priority**: Low  
**Component**: iOS App - Project Status Display  
**Beta Blocker**: No (Not needed for beta)  
**Discovered**: 2025-08-19  
**Status**: Deferred  

## Problem Description

Status indicator functionality is not necessary for beta release. Users can see when messages are being processed through the chat interface itself. This can be revisited post-beta if user feedback indicates it would improve the experience.

## Investigation Areas

1. Project status indicator implementation
2. Visual feedback for active project state
3. Connection status vs project status differentiation

## Expected Behavior

Project should show active/inactive status indicator when Claude is processing messages for that project.

## Files to Investigate

- iOS app project status display components
- Connection state management

## Status

**Current Status**: Deferred - Not needed for beta  
**Last Updated**: 2025-08-22

## Result

Deferred to post-beta based on user feedback priorities.
