**Description**: {{project_description}}  
**Type**: {{project_type}}  
**Tech Stack**: {{tech_stack}}  
**Version**: {{version}}  
**Status**: Planning

## Architecture Overview

### System Components
- [ ] Core Domain Models
- [ ] Data Layer
- [ ] Business Logic Layer
- [ ] API/Interface Layer
- [ ] Authentication & Authorization
- [ ] External Integrations

### Database Schema
```
TODO: Define tables, relationships, and constraints
```

### API Contracts
```
TODO: Define endpoints, request/response formats
```

### UI/UX Specifications
```
TODO: Define user flows, screens, and interactions
```

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)
- [ ] Project setup and configuration
- [ ] Database schema implementation
- [ ] Core domain models
- [ ] Basic CRUD operations
- [ ] Unit test framework setup

### Phase 2: Core Features (Week 2-3)
- [ ] User authentication
- [ ] Primary business logic
- [ ] API endpoints
- [ ] Integration tests
- [ ] Error handling

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Week 4-5)
- [ ] Additional features
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Security hardening
- [ ] End-to-end tests
- [ ] Documentation

### Phase 4: Polish & Deploy (Week 6)
- [ ] UI/UX refinements
- [ ] Performance testing
- [ ] Security audit
- [ ] Deployment setup
- [ ] Production monitoring

## Test Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Domain models
- Business logic
- Utility functions
- Data validation

### Integration Tests
- API endpoints
- Database operations
- External service calls
- Authentication flows

### End-to-End Tests
- Critical user journeys
- Payment flows (if applicable)
- Data integrity scenarios

## Security Considerations
- [ ] Input validation
- [ ] SQL injection prevention
- [ ] XSS protection
- [ ] CSRF tokens
- [ ] Rate limiting
- [ ] Secure password storage
- [ ] API authentication
- [ ] Data encryption

## Performance Requirements
- Response time: <200ms for API calls
- Throughput: Support {{team_size}} team concurrent users
- Database queries: Optimized with proper indexing
- Caching strategy: Redis/Memory cache for frequent data

## Deployment Strategy
- Environment: Development → Staging → Production
- CI/CD: Automated testing and deployment
- Monitoring: Application and infrastructure metrics
- Rollback: Blue-green deployment strategy

## Success Metrics
- [ ] All tests passing (>80% coverage)
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met
- [ ] Security scan passed
- [ ] Documentation complete
- [ ] User acceptance criteria met
