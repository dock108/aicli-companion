# Issue #8: Initial App Load Freezing with Input Queue Behavior

**Priority**: High  
**Component**: iOS App - Initial Load Performance  
**Beta Blocker**: Potentially (Poor first impression)  
**Discovered**: 2025-08-19  
**Status**: New  

## Problem Description

The iOS app freezes during initial load, followed by rapid processing of queued user input. The app appears to freeze for several seconds on launch, becoming unresponsive to user interaction. Once it unfreezes, it rapidly cycles through any input received during the frozen period. This may be an Xcode development build issue but needs investigation.

## Investigation Areas

1. Analyze app launch sequence in AppDelegate/Scene delegate for blocking operations
2. Profile the initial WebSocket connection establishment for synchronous blocking calls
3. Check if MessagePersistenceService initialization is performing heavy I/O on main thread
4. Review project list loading and any synchronous network calls during startup
5. Investigate if this is specific to debug builds or occurs in release builds too
6. Check for main thread blocking during Core Data/SwiftData initialization
7. Profile with Instruments to identify the exact freeze source
8. Review any synchronous authentication or configuration loading

## Expected Behavior

App should launch smoothly with responsive UI immediately. Any heavy initialization should happen asynchronously with appropriate loading indicators. User input should either be properly queued or the UI should indicate it's not ready for input.

## Files to Investigate

- `ios/Sources/AICLICompanion/AICLICompanionApp.swift` (app launch sequence)
- `ios/Sources/AICLICompanion/Services/WebSocketService.swift` (connection init)
- `ios/Sources/AICLICompanion/Services/MessagePersistenceService.swift` (data loading)
- `ios/Sources/AICLICompanion/ViewModels/ProjectListViewModel.swift` (initial project load)
- Check for any `.onAppear` modifiers doing synchronous work
- Profile with Time Profiler instrument to identify bottlenecks

## Root Cause Analysis

[To be determined after investigation]

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Async Initialization
- Move heavy operations off main thread
- Add loading states
- Progressive initialization

### 2. Input Handling
- Proper input queueing
- UI state indicators
- Prevent input during initialization

## Testing Requirements

### Manual Testing Steps
1. Test in both Debug and Release configurations
2. Test on actual device vs simulator
3. Monitor console for any timeout warnings
4. Check if issue persists after first launch (cold vs warm start)

### Test Scenarios
- [ ] Cold start performance
- [ ] Warm start performance
- [ ] Debug vs Release builds
- [ ] Device vs Simulator
