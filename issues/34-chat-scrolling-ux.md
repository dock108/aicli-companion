# Issue #34: Chat Scrolling UX Broken

**Priority**: Critical  
**Component**: iOS App - Chat View/Message List  
**Beta Blocker**: Yes - Major usability issue  
**Discovered**: 2025-08-22  
**Status**: New  

## Problem Description

The chat scrolling behavior is severely broken, making conversations difficult to follow and frustrating to use. The scroll position jumps around during message streaming, doesn't auto-scroll to new messages properly, and loses position when the keyboard appears/disappears. This is a critical UX issue that makes the app feel broken.

## Specific Problems

1. **Auto-scroll Failures**
   - New messages don't trigger scroll to bottom
   - User has to manually scroll to see Claude's responses
   - Scroll position gets lost between messages

2. **Streaming Position Jumps**
   - As Claude's response streams in, the scroll view jumps erratically
   - Can't read the response while it's being generated
   - Sometimes scrolls to top or middle randomly

3. **Keyboard Interaction Issues**
   - Opening keyboard doesn't adjust scroll properly
   - Closing keyboard loses scroll position
   - Content gets hidden behind keyboard

4. **Missing UI Elements**
   - No scroll-to-bottom button
   - No way to quickly get to latest message
   - No visual indicator when not at bottom

5. **Performance with Long Conversations**
   - Gets worse with 50+ messages
   - Becomes unusable with 100+ messages
   - Scroll becomes jerky and unresponsive

## Expected Behavior

- **Auto-scroll**: Automatically scroll to bottom when new message arrives (if already at bottom)
- **Stable streaming**: Maintain readable position while Claude's response streams
- **Keyboard handling**: Smoothly adjust content when keyboard appears/disappears
- **Scroll-to-bottom button**: Show floating button when scrolled up
- **Performance**: Handle 200+ messages smoothly

## Files to Investigate

- `ios/Sources/AICLICompanion/Views/Chat/ChatView.swift`
- `ios/Sources/AICLICompanion/Views/Chat/Components/MessageList.swift`
- `ios/Sources/AICLICompanion/Views/Chat/Components/ChatMessageList.swift`
- `ios/Sources/AICLICompanion/Views/Chat/ViewModels/ChatViewModel.swift`

## Technical Investigation Areas

1. **ScrollViewReader Usage**
   - Check if ScrollViewReader is properly implemented
   - Verify scroll anchors are set correctly
   - Ensure IDs are stable for messages

2. **Message List Updates**
   - How are messages being added to the list?
   - Is the list recreating views unnecessarily?
   - Are message IDs consistent?

3. **Keyboard Avoidance**
   - Is `.ignoresSafeArea(.keyboard)` being used correctly?
   - Check keyboard notification handling
   - Verify content insets

4. **Streaming Updates**
   - How is streaming content being appended?
   - Is the view updating too frequently?
   - Can we batch updates?

## Proposed Solution Approach

### 1. Implement Proper Auto-scroll
```swift
ScrollViewReader { proxy in
    ScrollView {
        // Message list
    }
    .onChange(of: messages.count) { _ in
        if isAtBottom {
            withAnimation {
                proxy.scrollTo(bottomID, anchor: .bottom)
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### 2. Add Scroll-to-Bottom Button
```swift
ZStack {
    // Message list
    
    if !isAtBottom {
        VStack {
            Spacer()
            HStack {
                Spacer()
                Button(action: scrollToBottom) {
                    Image(systemName: "arrow.down.circle.fill")
                }
                .padding()
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### 3. Stable Streaming Updates
- Use a timer to batch streaming updates
- Only update view every 100ms during streaming
- Maintain scroll position during updates

### 4. Better Keyboard Handling
- Use `.scrollDismissesKeyboard(.interactively)`
- Adjust content insets based on keyboard height
- Animate scroll position changes

## Testing Requirements

### Manual Testing Steps
1. Send a message and verify auto-scroll
2. Scroll up and send message - should NOT auto-scroll
3. Open/close keyboard repeatedly
4. Test with 100+ message conversation
5. Let Claude stream a long response
6. Rapidly send multiple messages

### Test Scenarios
- [ ] Auto-scroll works for new messages
- [ ] Scroll position stable during streaming
- [ ] Keyboard doesn't break scroll position
- [ ] Scroll-to-bottom button appears/works
- [ ] Performance good with 200+ messages
- [ ] Works on all iPhone sizes
- [ ] Works on iPad

## Success Criteria

1. Users never have to manually scroll to see new messages (when at bottom)
2. Can read Claude's response while it streams without jumping
3. Keyboard interaction feels smooth and natural
4. Performance remains smooth with long conversations
5. Scroll-to-bottom button provides quick navigation

## Notes

- This is marked as CRITICAL in plan.md Phase 1
- Multiple users have likely experienced this frustration
- Similar to WhatsApp/iMessage scrolling behavior as reference
- May need to consider LazyVStack vs ScrollView performance
