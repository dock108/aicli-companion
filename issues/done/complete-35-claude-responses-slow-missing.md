# Issue #35: Claude Responses Slow/Missing - RESOLVED ✅

**Priority**: CRITICAL  
**Component**: Server - Claude Code CLI Integration  
**Beta Blocker**: Yes - Core functionality broken  
**Discovered**: 2025-08-22  
**Status**: RESOLVED ✅  
**Resolution Date**: 2025-08-22  

## Problem Description

Claude responses were extremely slow or missing entirely. The root cause was that Claude Code CLI was loading and analyzing entire project context files (CLAUDE.md and plan.md) before responding to simple messages.

## Root Cause Identified

1. **CLAUDE.md files were too prescriptive** - Contained detailed instructions that made Claude overthink simple interactions
2. **mini-golf-break project had problematic CLAUDE.md** - Instructed Claude to "Always check for plan.md first and execute it step-by-step"
3. **Claude was loading full project context** - Even for simple "Hello" messages, analyzing entire projects

## Evidence

- Simple "Hello" took 1m 36s to respond
- Claude was responding with project status instead of conversational replies
- Response content showed Claude was analyzing project implementation instead of responding normally

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Simplified all CLAUDE.md files across projects
- Reduced from 200+ lines to ~40-50 lines
- Removed prescriptive instructions
- Added "User First" principle - don't auto-execute plans
- Made guidelines general, not specific

### 2. Fixed mini-golf-break CLAUDE.md
- Removed "Always check for plan.md first and execute it step-by-step"
- Added "Only work on plan.md when user references it"
- Aligned with other projects' CLAUDE.md format

### 3. Key Changes to All CLAUDE.md Files
```markdown
## Core Principles

### 1. User First
- Always prioritize what the user is asking for
- Don't assume or execute plans/issues unless explicitly requested
- Respond conversationally to greetings and questions

### 2. Keep It Simple
- Choose simple solutions over complex ones
- Don't add features that weren't requested
- Write clear, readable code
```

## Testing Results

After simplification:
- Response time reduced from 90+ seconds to 3-6 seconds
- Claude responds conversationally to greetings
- No more auto-loading of project plans
- Consistent response times across multiple tests

## Files Modified

1. `/Users/michaelfuscoletti/Desktop/aicli-companion/CLAUDE.md` - Simplified to 51 lines
2. `/Users/michaelfuscoletti/Desktop/mini-golf-break/CLAUDE.md` - Simplified to 45 lines  
3. `/Users/michaelfuscoletti/Desktop/prediction-poc/CLAUDE.md` - Simplified to 40 lines

## Lessons Learned

- CLAUDE.md should contain general guidelines, not detailed instructions
- User directives must always take precedence over any default behavior
- Project context loading should be minimal for simple interactions
- Overly prescriptive instructions cause Claude to overthink responses

## Status

**Current Status**: RESOLVED ✅  
**Last Updated**: 2025-08-22  
**Resolution**: Simplified CLAUDE.md files across all projects to prevent Claude from auto-loading and analyzing project context for simple messages. Response times now 3-6 seconds instead of 90+ seconds.
