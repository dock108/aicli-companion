# Issue #17: Hide Unimplemented Settings Options

**Priority**: High  
**Component**: iOS App - Settings UI  
**Beta Blocker**: Yes (Confusing UX, gives impression of broken features)  
**Discovered**: 2025-08-21

## Problem Description

Hide or disable all settings options that are not yet implemented to avoid user confusion and the appearance of broken functionality. This is critical for beta release to maintain professional appearance and avoid user frustration.

## Tasks

1. Audit all settings views (General, Advanced, any other tabs)
2. Identify which settings are actually connected to working functionality
3. Hide or remove settings that are placeholders or unimplemented:
   - Comment out the UI elements rather than deleting (for easy re-enabling)
   - Add TODO comments indicating what needs implementation
4. For partially working features, either complete them or hide entirely
5. Ensure remaining visible settings all have proper:
   - Persistence (settings are saved and restored)
   - Immediate effect when changed
   - Appropriate validation and error handling
6. Add "Coming Soon" section if desired for transparency about future features
7. Test all remaining visible settings to confirm they work as expected

## Expected Behavior

Every visible setting in the app should have a working implementation. No placeholder or "dead" UI elements should be present in the beta release. Users should only see options they can actually use.

## Files to Investigate/Modify

- `ios/Sources/AICLICompanion/Views/Settings/GeneralSettingsView.swift`
- `ios/Sources/AICLICompanion/Views/Settings/AdvancedSettingsView.swift`
- `ios/Sources/AICLICompanion/Views/Settings/SecuritySettingsView.swift`
- `ios/Sources/AICLICompanion/SettingsView.swift`
- `ios/Sources/AICLICompanion/SettingsManager.swift`
- Any other settings-related views or view models

## Specific Items to Check

- Theme selection (if not working)
- Notification settings (if not implemented)
- Sync settings (if CloudKit not ready)
- Advanced developer options
- Any experimental features
- Keyboard shortcuts (if not functional)
- Export/Import settings (if not implemented)
- Auto-response mode settings
- Appearance settings
- Behavior settings
- Privacy settings

## Status

**Current Status**: ✅ FIXED - Security tab hidden for beta  
**Last Updated**: 2025-08-21

### Implementation Complete

- ✅ Audited all settings views and identified implementations
- ✅ Hidden Security tab (too complex for beta, needs thorough testing)
- ✅ Kept functional settings: Connection, Auto Mode, Appearance, Behavior, Notifications, Privacy, Advanced, About
- ✅ Added TODO markers for re-enabling after beta
- ✅ All remaining visible settings have working implementations

### Settings Status:
- **Connection**: ✅ Fully functional (shows status, disconnect/reconnect)
- **Security**: ❌ Hidden for beta (complex features need testing)
- **Auto Mode**: ✅ Working with AutoResponseManager
- **Appearance**: ✅ Theme and font size working
- **Behavior**: ✅ All toggles connected to settings
- **Notifications**: ✅ Has PushNotificationService implementation
- **Privacy**: ✅ Clear chat history works
- **Advanced**: ✅ Debug mode and reset settings work
- **About**: ✅ Version and links work
