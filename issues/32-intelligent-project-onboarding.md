# Issue #32: Intelligent Project Onboarding & Planning System

**Priority**: High  
**Component**: AI-Powered Project Creation & Planning Validation  
**Beta Blocker**: No  
**Discovered**: 2025-08-27  
**Status**: New  
**Resolved**: [YYYY-MM-DD if resolved]

## Problem Description

Need to implement a comprehensive intelligent project onboarding system that provides professional-grade project creation with built-in planning validation. The system should guide users through proper project setup, validate requirements completeness, and ensure projects start with everything needed for successful development.

**This tool is specifically designed for building modular, production-grade applications** - not quick prompts or proof-of-concepts. It's for technical users who need structured, enterprise-level development workflows: experienced engineers building real production systems with proper architecture, testing, and deployment considerations.

The system should provide:

**Intelligent Project Creation:**
- In-app project creation with enterprise-grade templates
- Auto-generation of essential project files (plan.md, CLAUDE.md, issues/)
- Template customization based on project type and requirements
- Version-controlled template evolution

**Planning Session Intelligence:**
- Real-time requirements completeness assessment
- Intelligent gap detection across all project domains
- Database schema validation and relationship checking
- API contract completeness verification
- UI/UX specification validation
- Security and authentication requirement checks
- Performance and scalability consideration validation
- Deployment and infrastructure requirement analysis

**Smart Validation & Feedback:**
- Readiness scoring with confidence metrics
- Specific identification of missing requirements
- Contextual warnings about incomplete specifications
- Automated checklist generation for gap resolution
- Override mechanism with informed consent

**Target Use Cases:**
- Senior engineers prototyping new products with production intent
- Technical founders building MVPs with proper engineering foundations
- Engineering teams doing rapid iteration on real features
- Advanced developers who want structured, repeatable development workflows

## Investigation Areas

1. **Project Creation System**:
   - In-app project folder creation and management
   - Template file auto-generation system
   - Project switching and organization
   - Template versioning and evolution

2. **Template Generation Engine**:
   - Dynamic template customization based on project type
   - TDD workflow automation using plan.md structure
   - CLAUDE.md guidelines with project-specific rules
   - Issue template generation with acceptance criteria
   - Version control integration for template files

3. **Planning Validation Intelligence** ‚≠ê *Critical Component*:
   - Requirements completeness assessment algorithms
   - Multi-domain gap detection (DB, API, UI/UX, Security, etc.)
   - Confidence scoring and readiness metrics
   - Natural language processing for requirement extraction
   - Pattern matching for common missing specifications

4. **Intelligent Feedback System**:
   - Real-time validation during planning conversations
   - Specific, actionable feedback on missing items
   - Severity levels for different types of gaps
   - Checklist generation with priority ordering
   - Context-aware suggestions for completion

5. **UI/UX Components**:
   - Project creation wizard interface
   - Template editing and preview system
   - Project browser and management UI
   - Planning validation dashboard
   - Requirements checklist view

## Expected Behavior

**Professional Project Creation Flow:**
1. User taps "New Project" in iOS app
2. App prompts for project details:
   - Project name and description
   - Architecture type (monolith, microservices, serverless)
   - Target environment (web, mobile, desktop)
   - Team size and collaboration needs
3. System auto-generates enterprise-grade templates:
   - `plan.md` - Comprehensive TDD planning document
   - `CLAUDE.md` - Engineering guidelines and quality gates
   - `issues/template.md` - Structured issue template
   - Additional templates based on project type
4. Opens planning session with intelligent validation

**Planning Session Validation Flow:**
1. User discusses project requirements with Claude
2. System continuously analyzes conversation for completeness
3. Real-time assessment across critical domains:
   - **Database**: Schema, relationships, constraints, migrations
   - **API**: Contracts, endpoints, authentication, rate limiting
   - **UI/UX**: User flows, wireframes, component specifications
   - **Security**: Authentication, authorization, data protection
   - **Performance**: Load expectations, caching, optimization
   - **Infrastructure**: Deployment, monitoring, scaling
4. Dynamic feedback provided:
   - ‚úÖ "Database schema looks complete with all relationships defined"
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è "Missing API authentication strategy - OAuth2, JWT, or API keys?"
   - üö® "No UI component specifications found for user dashboard"
   - üìã "7 requirements still needed before development ready"
5. Readiness score updates in real-time
6. Override option available with clear warnings

**Template Evolution:**
1. Templates start at v0.1.0 during creation
2. Planning session refinements increment to v0.x
3. Ready for development promotes to v1.0.0
4. Project-specific customizations tracked
5. Learnings can be saved back as new template variants
