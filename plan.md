# Technical Debt Cleanup & Architecture Alignment Plan

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This plan systematically addresses the 15-20% code duplication, ~40 dead files, and 3,000+ lines of removable code identified in the comprehensive code review. The plan is structured as executable phases that AI coding agents can complete autonomously, focusing on immediate wins first, then progressing to deeper architectural improvements.

## CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS

### Code Review Findings (from CODE_REVIEW.md)
- **~15-20% code duplication** between iOS and macOS platforms
- **~40 files of dead code** including unused views, services, and incomplete features
- **3,000+ lines of removable code** from build artifacts, test results, and stub implementations
- **Architecture violations** where server maintains state despite being "stateless"
- **Redundant implementations** of parsers, validators, and session managers
- **Test infrastructure duplication** causing slower test execution

### Priority Issues to Address
1. Build artifacts committed to repository (~20% size bloat)
2. Dead views and services taking up space
3. Duplicate KeychainManager and SettingsManager between platforms
4. Server violating stateless architecture principle
5. Incomplete CloudKit integration (technical debt)
6. Multiple parser and validator implementations
7. Global state patterns despite architectural guidelines

## AI AGENT EXECUTION INSTRUCTIONS

### Execution Guidelines:
1. **Execute phases in order** - Each phase builds on the previous
2. **Complete all TODOs in a phase** before moving to next
3. **Run tests after each phase** to ensure nothing breaks
4. **Commit after each phase** with clear message
5. **Stop and alert if blocked** by architectural decisions
6. **Use SwiftLint/ESLint** after code changes
7. **Update imports** when moving/deleting files
8. **Verify app builds** after each phase

### Commit Message Format:
```
chore(phase-N): [Phase Title]

- [List of major changes]
- [Impact metrics if available]

Part of technical debt cleanup from CODE_REVIEW.md
```

### Critical Patterns to Follow:
```swift
// ALWAYS DELETE these patterns when found:
// - Commented-out code (unless feature-flagged)
// - Unused imports
// - Empty stub methods
// - Test result files
// - Build artifacts
// - Duplicate implementations
```

### Feature Flag Exceptions:
Only preserve code if:
- It's controlled by FeatureFlags and may be re-enabled
- It's part of a documented future feature
- There's an active TODO referencing it

## NOTES FOR AI AGENTS

This plan supersedes the previous plan.md which focused on app state issues (now resolved). This new plan addresses technical debt identified in CODE_REVIEW.md.

When executing:
1. Read CODE_REVIEW.md for detailed context on each issue
2. Follow CLAUDE.md principles throughout
3. Preserve user data and settings
4. Maintain backwards compatibility where possible
5. Document any breaking changes

The plan is designed for autonomous execution with clear checkpoints. Stop and request user input only at specified decision points.

---

## POST-IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

### Critical Changes for Testing:
1. **Server is now stateless** - No session files should be created
2. **iOS uses local-first storage** - Messages persist locally
3. **Dependency injection replaced singletons** - Check for proper injection
4. **Message virtualization limits rendering** - Only 100 messages shown
5. **CloudKit completely removed** - No sync features available

### Known Testing Considerations:
- First message in new conversation has no sessionId (Claude generates it)
- APNS is primary delivery method for Claude responses
- RequestId crucial for message routing
- Message optimizer may truncate very long messages
- Performance improvements most visible with 100+ messages

### Test Environment Setup:
```bash
# Quick setup for testing
git checkout user_testing  # Current branch with all changes
cd server && npm install && npm test  # Verify server tests
cd ../ios && open App/App.xcodeproj  # Open iOS for testing
```
