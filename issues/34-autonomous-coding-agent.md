# Issue #34: Autonomous Coding Agent with In-App Project Creation

**Priority**: High  
**Component**: AI Automation - Full Development Ecosystem  
**Beta Blocker**: No  
**Discovered**: 2025-08-27  
**Status**: New  
**Resolved**: [YYYY-MM-DD if resolved]

## Problem Description

Need to implement a comprehensive autonomous coding agent system that shifts the entire development workflow "further left" into the AICLI Companion app. 

**This tool is specifically designed for building modular, production-grade applications** - not quick prompts to turn cool ideas into reality. While vibe codes and POCs have their place in development, this system is the opposite of that approach. It's for technical users who need structured, enterprise-level development workflows: experienced engineers building real production systems with proper architecture, testing, and deployment considerations.

The system should provide:

**Core Agent Intelligence (Includes Auto-Reply from Issue #4):**
- Automatic conversation continuation without manual intervention
- Intelligent response generation based on Claude's output
- "continue testing" - proceed with current test suite
- "reread claude cause you didn't follow the rules" - review guidelines and correct approach  
- "it's time for the next sprint" - move to next development phase
- "hey we really hit a showstopper drop everything and alert Mike" - escalate critical issues
- Smart stop conditions (iteration limits, task completion, errors)
- Repository rules (CLAUDE.md) integration for context-aware replies

**Professional Project Creation Workflow:**
- In-app project creation with enterprise-grade template files
- Technical planning sessions for architecture and implementation strategy
- Complete production development lifecycle management from conception through deployment
- Support for real engineering practices: proper testing, CI/CD, security considerations, scalability planning

**Target Use Cases:**
- Senior engineers prototyping new product ideas with production intent
- Technical founders building MVP with proper engineering foundations
- Engineering teams doing rapid iteration on real features
- Advanced developers who want structured, repeatable development workflows

The agent should integrate with professional TDD workflows using auto-generated templates that enforce engineering rigor, starting from ground zero with enterprise-level task management all within the iOS app.

## Investigation Areas

1. **Autonomous Agent Core**:
   - Message parsing and intent recognition capabilities
   - Response selection engine design  
   - Showstopper detection criteria and escalation mechanisms
   - State management for perpetual operation

2. **Project Creation System**:
   - In-app project folder creation and management
   - Template file auto-generation system
   - Project switching and organization

3. **Template Integration**:
   - TDD workflow automation using plan.md structure (reference: `/Users/michaelfuscoletti/Desktop/dfs_ml`)
   - Dynamic template customization based on project type
   - Version control integration for template files

4. **Planning Session Validation Engine** ‚≠ê *Critical Sub-Issue*:
   - Requirements completeness assessment system
   - Intelligent gap detection for missing specifications
   - Database schema validation and completeness checks
   - Architecture review automation with readiness scoring
   - Override mechanism with playful warnings for incomplete builds
   - Checklist generation for missing requirements (UI/UX specs, API contracts, data models, etc.)

5. **UI/UX Components**:
   - New project creation interface
   - Template editing and preview system
   - Project browser and management UI
   - Planning session validation dashboard

## Expected Behavior

**Professional Project Creation Flow:**
- Technical user taps "New Project" in iOS app
- App prompts for project details (name, architecture type, target environment, team size)
- Auto-creates project folder with 3 enterprise-grade template files:
  - `plan.md` - Comprehensive TDD planning document with technical specifications
  - `CLAUDE.md` - Engineering guidelines with persistence rules and quality gates
  - `issues/template.md` - Structured issue template with proper technical requirements
- Opens technical planning session for architecture discussion and template refinement

**Planning Session Validation Flow:**
- System continuously analyzes planning conversation for completeness
- Intelligent assessment of requirements across critical domains:
  - Database schema and data relationships
  - API contracts and integration points
  - UI/UX specifications and user flows
  - Authentication and security requirements
  - Performance and scalability considerations
  - Deployment and infrastructure needs
- **Readiness Assessment Responses:**
  - ‚úÖ "Ready to build! All critical requirements identified."
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è "Not ready yet - we still need: [specific missing items]"
  - üö® "Incomplete database requirements detected - missing [table relationships/constraints/etc.]"
  - üìã "Generated checklist of 7 remaining specifications needed before development"
- **Override Mechanism:** "Hey, we're telling you playfully - this might be a bumpy ride without [missing specs], but if you want to proceed anyway..."

**Autonomous Agent Intelligence:**
- Parse incoming messages to understand context and intent
- Select appropriate predefined responses based on message analysis
- Integrate seamlessly with project-specific contexts
- Follow TDD principles using auto-generated documentation
- Operate continuously without manual intervention
- Escalate critical issues when showstoppers are detected
- Guide users through complete development lifecycle

**Professional In-App Development Workflow:**
- Project browser with enterprise project organization
- Technical template editing with architecture validation
- Issue creation with proper technical requirements and acceptance criteria
- Integration with Claude CLI for production-ready code execution
- Support for real engineering workflows: testing strategies, deployment planning, performance considerations
