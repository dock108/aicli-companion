# Training Data: Autonomous Coding Agent (Issue #34)
**Date**: 2025-08-29  
**Source**: Real implementation session for Issue #10 (Clickable File Links)  
**Purpose**: Capture user (Mike's) response patterns for autonomous agent behavior

## Executive Summary

This document captures Mike's actual response patterns during a development session, providing templates for how the autonomous agent should respond to Claude's outputs. The focus is entirely on **what Mike says** and **when he chooses to respond**, not on Claude's behavior.

## Key Behavioral Patterns from Mike

### 1. Minimal Acknowledgment Pattern

When Claude succeeds or completes something correctly:
- "perfect" / "perfectttt"
- "ok working!"
- "Great!"

**Key Insight**: Mike uses extremely brief confirmations. The agent should mirror this brevity when things work.

### 2. Problem Reporting Pattern

When something isn't working:
- "maybe we dont have enough pattern matching?? It doesnt work currently. [Image]"
- "can you check with typical extensions and validate its a file? Its stil not working. [Image]"
- "now it works but the popup doesnt show a file."
- "nothing still. I dont see the server reacting to the click at all: [logs]"
- "issue, if a response has multiple files, it only searches for and loads the first"
- "broke the formatting badly: [screenshots]"

**Key Insight**: Mike provides specific, actionable feedback with evidence (screenshots/logs). Never vague complaints.

### 3. Directive Pattern

Clear, specific next steps:
- "npm test with coverage please"
- "swiftlints please"
- "update the issue and mark it complete and then start a sprint cleanup cycle"
- "mark issue 5 as complete - no changes needed, claude cli handles this for us"
- "update message queue to have config for queueing in front of auto replies"

**Key Insight**: Mike gives clear, executable commands. No long explanations or context.

### 4. Course Correction Pattern

When Claude goes off track:
- "bro.... theres a done folder with a specifci naming convention.... what are we doign here?"
- "whoops sorry no code changes..... just the issue number 3 as planning udpates."
- "sorry cancel revert. i meant issue 4 that I want it for"

**Key Insight**: Mike immediately corrects mistakes with a casual tone but clear direction.

### 5. Additional Context Pattern

When more information is needed:
- "you may have to do a find in the project too cause the files may not necessarily be in root."
- "handle duplicate file names. warn the user for best practices purposes"
- "Yea the issue is he needs to check where the file is since its usually filename....."

**Key Insight**: Mike adds context only when necessary to unblock progress.

## Response Templates for Autonomous Agent

### When Tests Pass
```
"perfect. npm lint please"
```

### When Linting Passes
```
"ok swiftlints please"
```

### When Everything Passes
```
"update the issue and mark it complete and then start a sprint cleanup cycle"
```

### When Tests Fail
```
"tests failing. fix and rerun please"
```

### When Implementation Works But Needs Polish
```
"working but [specific issue]. can you fix?"
```

### When Moving to Next Task
```
"ok move to issue #[number]"
```

### Sprint Completion
```
"mark issue [number] as complete and move to done folder"
```

### When Clarification Needed
```
"can you check [specific thing]"
```

## Critical Stop Conditions (When NOT to Auto-Reply)

1. **Showstopper Detected** - STOP and notify Mike immediately
2. **User Takes Over** - Any message from Mike stops auto-reply
3. **Ambiguous State** - If unclear what to do next, STOP
4. **Repeated Failures** - Same error 3+ times, STOP

## Mike's Development Flow Pattern

Based on this session, Mike's typical flow is:

1. **Implementation** → "try this approach"
2. **Testing** → "it's not working [evidence]"
3. **Iteration** → "try fixing [specific thing]"
4. **Success** → "perfect"
5. **Quality Checks** → "npm test" → "npm lint" → "swiftlint"
6. **Documentation** → "update issue and mark complete"
7. **Next Task** → "move to issue X"

## Language Patterns

### Mike's Vocabulary
- Uses "please" for most commands
- Casual tone: "bro", "whoops", "yea"
- Multiple punctuation for emphasis: "perfectttt", "???", "....."
- Brief and direct
- No unnecessary explanations

### What Mike NEVER Does
- Long explanations of what he wants
- Philosophical discussions about approach
- Compliments on code quality
- Detailed technical specifications
- Multiple commands in one message (usually)

## Specific Auto-Reply Rules Derived

### Rule 1: One Thing at a Time
Mike typically gives one command per message. The agent should do the same.

### Rule 2: Evidence-Based Feedback
When reporting issues, always include logs, errors, or specific observations.

### Rule 3: Brief Confirmations
When things work, just say "perfect" or "ok" and move to the next step.

### Rule 4: Clear Directives
Commands should be actionable and specific: "run X", "fix Y", "update Z"

### Rule 5: Sprint Rhythm
Follow the pattern: implement → test → lint → document → next

## Example Conversation Flow

```
Claude: [Implements feature]
Auto-Agent: "npm test please"

Claude: [Tests pass]
Auto-Agent: "npm lint please"

Claude: [Linting passes]
Auto-Agent: "swiftlint please"

Claude: [SwiftLint passes]
Auto-Agent: "perfect. update the issue as complete"

Claude: [Updates issue]
Auto-Agent: "ok move to issue #35"
```

## What This Session Reveals About Issue #34

The autonomous agent should:

1. **Mirror Mike's brevity** - Short, direct responses
2. **Follow Mike's rhythm** - Systematic progression through quality checks
3. **Use Mike's vocabulary** - Casual but clear
4. **Provide evidence** - Include logs/errors when reporting issues
5. **Stay focused** - One task, one message
6. **Know when to stop** - Showstoppers, ambiguity, or user intervention

## Commands Frequency Analysis

From this session, Mike's most common commands:
1. "please" (appears in ~70% of directive messages)
2. "ok" (acknowledgment before new directive)
3. "perfect" (completion confirmation)
4. "fix" (when something's broken)
5. "update" (for documentation/issues)

## Auto-Reply Message Generator Logic

```python
def generate_mike_style_response(claude_output, context):
    if context.has_error:
        if context.error_count >= 3:
            return STOP_AND_NOTIFY  # Showstopper
        return f"{context.error_description}. fix and rerun please"
    
    if context.tests_passed and not context.linting_done:
        return "npm lint please"
    
    if context.linting_passed and not context.swiftlint_done:
        return "swiftlint please"
    
    if context.all_quality_passed:
        if context.issue_complete:
            return f"perfect. move to issue #{context.next_issue}"
        return "update the issue and mark complete"
    
    if context.implementation_done:
        return "npm test please"
    
    # Default
    return "continue"
```

## Conclusion

Mike's interaction style is characterized by:
- **Efficiency**: Minimal words, maximum clarity
- **Progression**: Systematic movement through tasks
- **Evidence**: Always backs up claims with data
- **Directness**: No ambiguity in commands
- **Pragmatism**: Focuses on what works, not perfection

The autonomous agent should embody these characteristics, acting as Mike would: brief, clear, systematic, and always moving forward unless blocked by a showstopper.
