# Sophisticated Push Notifications Implementation

This document summarizes the implementation of the sophisticated push notification system for the Claude Companion app.

## Overview

The implementation consists of three main parts as requested:
1. **Stream Claude output as individual chat messages** - Claude's responses are parsed into semantic chunks
2. **Update local server API to support streaming** - Server emits structured chunks with metadata
3. **Push notification on final message only** - iOS app sends a single notification when streaming completes

## Server-Side Implementation

### 1. Stream Parser Service (`server/src/services/stream-parser.js`)
- Parses Claude's raw output into structured chunks
- Identifies different content types: headers, sections, code blocks, lists, text, etc.
- Buffers incomplete lines for proper streaming
- Marks the final chunk with `isFinal: true`

### 2. AICLI Service Updates (`server/src/services/aicli.js`)
- Integrated ClaudeStreamParser into stdout handling
- Emits `streamChunk` events with structured data
- Properly handles final chunk emission on process close

### 3. WebSocket Service Updates (`server/src/services/websocket.js`)
- Added handler for `streamChunk` events from AICLI service
- Broadcasts structured chunks to connected clients
- Includes `isFinal` flag and metadata in messages

## iOS Client Implementation

### 1. Message Types (`ios/Sources/AICLICompanion/Message.swift`)
- Added `streamChunk` message type to WebSocketMessageType enum
- Created StreamChunkResponse, StreamChunk, and StreamChunkMetadata structs
- Updated message decoding/encoding to handle new type

### 2. WebSocket Service (`ios/Sources/AICLICompanion/WebSocketService.swift`)
- Added `handleStreamChunk` method to process incoming chunks
- Logs chunk details for debugging

### 3. Claude Response Streamer (`ios/Sources/AICLICompanion/ClaudeResponseStreamer.swift`)
- New service that collects and manages streaming chunks
- MessageBuilder class intelligently formats chunks into readable messages
- Maintains streaming state and emits completion notifications

### 4. Push Notification Service (`ios/Sources/AICLICompanion/PushNotificationService.swift`)
- Manages notification authorization and settings
- Sends notifications with Claude response preview
- Supports actions: View Response, Copy, Dismiss
- Includes full response in notification for copy action

### 5. Chat View Updates (`ios/Sources/AICLICompanion/ChatView.swift`)
- Integrated ClaudeResponseStreamer to observe streaming messages
- Updates UI in real-time as chunks arrive
- Sends push notification when streaming completes

### 6. App Configuration
- Updated Info.plist with NSUserNotificationUsageDescription
- Added push notification authorization request on app launch

## Message Flow

1. User sends a message to Claude
2. Server receives Claude's stdout and parses it into chunks
3. Each chunk is emitted via WebSocket with structure and metadata
4. iOS client receives chunks and updates UI in real-time
5. When final chunk arrives (isFinal: true), a push notification is sent
6. User can interact with notification to view, copy, or dismiss

## Chunk Types

The parser identifies and structures these content types:
- **Headers**: Markdown headers with levels
- **Sections**: Named sections like "Plan:", "Code:", "Summary:"
- **Code Blocks**: With language metadata
- **Lists**: Bullet and numbered lists
- **Text**: Regular paragraphs
- **Dividers**: Horizontal rules

## Benefits

1. **Better UX**: Users see Claude's response building progressively
2. **Structured Content**: Responses are properly formatted with sections
3. **Single Notification**: Users aren't spammed with multiple notifications
4. **Rich Actions**: Can copy full response directly from notification
5. **Performance**: Chunked streaming prevents memory issues with large responses

## Testing

To test the implementation:
1. Send a complex request to Claude that generates a long response
2. Observe chunks appearing in real-time in the chat
3. Check that a single push notification appears when complete
4. Test notification actions (view, copy, dismiss)
