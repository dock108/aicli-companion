# Stateless Server Architecture - Implementation Complete

## Summary of Changes

The Claude Companion server has been successfully transformed into a stateless message router that simply passes messages between the iOS app and Claude CLI without maintaining any session state or persistence.

## What Was Removed

### 1. Welcome Messages
- ✅ Removed `sendWelcomeMessage()` from connection manager
- ✅ Server no longer sends initialization messages to clients

### 2. Session Persistence
- ✅ Removed all `sessionPersistence` imports and usage
- ✅ Disabled session restoration on server startup
- ✅ Removed message buffer persistence
- ✅ Server starts fresh every time - no old sessions loaded

### 3. Message Queue Service
- ✅ Removed `getMessageQueueService()` imports and usage
- ✅ No more message queuing or buffering
- ✅ Messages are handled in real-time only

### 4. Session Tracking
- ✅ Connection manager no longer tracks sessions per client
- ✅ Removed `addSessionToClient()` and `removeSessionFromClient()`
- ✅ Server doesn't know or care about client sessions

### 5. Push Notifications
- ✅ Simplified to just acknowledge device registration
- ✅ No actual push notification management on server

### 6. Project Start Notifications
- ✅ iOS app no longer notifies server when selecting projects
- ✅ Removed `/api/projects/:name/start` endpoint
- ✅ Project selection is purely local to iOS app

## What the Server Does Now

### Pure Message Router
1. **Receives** WebSocket messages from iOS
2. **Passes** commands to Claude CLI
3. **Returns** Claude's responses to iOS
4. **Uses** requestId to ensure correct routing

### Minimal Endpoints
- `/api/projects` - Lists available project folders
- `/api/health` - Health check
- `/ws` - WebSocket connection for messages

### Stateless Operations
- **No session creation** - Claude creates sessions
- **No state persistence** - Nothing saved to disk
- **No message buffering** - Real-time only
- **No client tracking** - Just connection management

## Message Flow

### First Message (No Session)
```
iOS → Server: { sessionId: null, command: "Hello", requestId: "123" }
Server → Claude: claude "Hello"
Claude → Server: { session_id: "abc", response: "Hi!" }
Server → iOS: { sessionId: "abc", content: "Hi!", requestId: "123" }
```

### Continued Conversation
```
iOS → Server: { sessionId: "abc", command: "Help", requestId: "456" }
Server → Claude: claude --session-id abc "Help"
Claude → Server: { response: "Sure!" }
Server → iOS: { sessionId: "abc", content: "Sure!", requestId: "456" }
```

## Benefits of Stateless Architecture

1. **Simplicity** - Server code is much simpler and easier to maintain
2. **Reliability** - No state corruption or sync issues
3. **Scalability** - Server can restart without losing context
4. **Independence** - iOS app manages its own state
5. **Performance** - No disk I/O for persistence

## Files Modified

### Server Files
- `websocket-message-handlers.js` - Simplified all handlers
- `websocket-connection-manager.js` - Removed session tracking
- `aicli.js` - Removed startup cleanup and persistence
- `aicli-session-manager.js` - Disabled all persistence
- `plan.md` - Updated with new architecture

### iOS Files
- `ProjectSelectionView.swift` - Already updated (no server notifications)
- Other iOS files already compatible with stateless server

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Server starts without loading old sessions
- [x] No welcome messages sent on connection
- [x] Messages route correctly with requestId
- [x] Claude creates and manages session IDs
- [x] iOS app stores session IDs locally
- [x] Project selection doesn't notify server
- [x] Clear chat just acknowledges without cleanup
- [x] Server can restart without affecting iOS state

## Next Steps

1. **Test parallel messages** from multiple chat windows
2. **Verify memory usage** stays low over time
3. **Confirm no session files** created in `.aicli-sessions`
4. **Test reconnection** after network interruption

## Migration Complete

The server is now fully stateless and operates as a pure message router between iOS and Claude CLI. All session management is handled by Claude CLI itself, and all UI state is managed by the iOS app.
