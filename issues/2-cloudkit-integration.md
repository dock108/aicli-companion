# Issue #2: CloudKit Integration for Cross-Device Sync

**Priority**: High  
**Component**: iOS App - CloudKit Integration  
**Beta Blocker**: No  
**Discovered**: 2025-08-19  
**Status**: New  

## Problem Description

Implement CloudKit integration to enable cross-device synchronization of chat sessions and messages. The app should sync conversation history, session states, and project contexts across all devices logged into the same iCloud account. Currently, each device maintains isolated local storage with no cross-device communication.

## Investigation Areas

1. Enable CloudKit capability in the iOS app target
2. Create CloudKit container and record types for messages, sessions, and project metadata
3. Implement MessagePersistenceService extensions to sync with CloudKit
4. Add conflict resolution for messages edited on multiple devices
5. Handle offline mode with proper sync queue when connection restored
6. Implement subscription notifications for real-time updates across devices
7. Add privacy and security controls for CloudKit data
8. Test sync performance with large message histories

## Expected Behavior

When a user sends messages on iPhone, they should appear on iPad/Mac instantly. Session context and conversation history should seamlessly transfer between devices.

## Files to Investigate

- `ios/Sources/AICLICompanion/Services/MessagePersistenceService.swift`
- `ios/Sources/AICLICompanion/Services/CloudKitSyncService.swift` (needs creation)
- `ios/AICLICompanion.xcodeproj` (for CloudKit capability)
- `ios/Sources/AICLICompanion/Models/Message.swift` (for CKRecord compatibility)
- `ios/Sources/AICLICompanion/ViewModels/ChatViewModel.swift` (for sync triggers)

## Testing Requirements

### Manual Testing Steps
1. Test with multiple devices on same iCloud account
2. Verify message sync latency < 3 seconds
3. Test conflict resolution when same session edited on two devices
4. Verify offline queue and sync on reconnection
5. Test with 1000+ message history performance

### Test Scenarios
- [ ] Message sync between iPhone and iPad
- [ ] Session restoration on new device
- [ ] Offline message queue
- [ ] Conflict resolution
- [ ] Large history performance
